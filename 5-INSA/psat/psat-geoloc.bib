	abstract = {Web scraping is the set of techniques used to automatically get some information from a website instead of manually copying it. The goal of a Web scraper is to look for certain kinds of information, extract, and aggregate it into new Web pages. In particular, scrapers are focused on transforming unstructured data and save them in structured databases. In this paper, among others kind of scraping, we focus on those techniques that extract the content of a Web page. In particular, we adopt scraping techniques in the Web advertising field. To this end, we propose a collaborative filtering-based Web advertising system aimed at finding the most relevant ads for a generic Web page by exploiting Web scraping. To illustrate how the system works in practice, a case study is presented.},

	abstract = {In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica controversy, social media platform providers such as Facebook and Twitter have severely restricted access to platform data via their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). This has had a particularly critical effect on the ability of social media researchers to investigate phenomena such as abuse, hate speech, trolling, and disinformation campaigns, and to hold the platforms to account for the role that their affordances and policies might play in facilitating such dysfunction. Alternative data access frameworks, such as Facebook’s partnership with the controversial Social Science One initiative, represent an insufficient replacement for fully functional APIs, and the platform providers’ actions in responding to the Cambridge Analytica scandal raise suspicions that they have instrumentalised it to actively frustrate critical, independent, public interest scrutiny by scholars. Building on a critical review of Facebook’s public statements through its own platforms and the mainstream media, and of the scholarly responses these have drawn, this article outlines the societal implications of the ‘APIcalypse’, and reviews potential options for scholars in responding to it.},

	abstract = {The reports of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections brought into the center of public attention concerns related to the ability of foreign actors to increase social discord and take advantage of personal user data for political purposes. It has raised questions regarding the ways and the extent to which data can be used to create psychographical proﬁles to determine what kind of advertisement would be most eﬀective to persuade a particular person in a particular location for some political event; Questions which have not been explored yet due to the lack of publicly available data. In this work, we study the political ads dataset collected by ProPublica, an American nonproﬁt newsroom, using a network of volunteers in the period before the 2018 US midterm elections. With the help of the volunteers, it has been made possible to collect not only the content of the ads but also the attributes that were used by advertisers to target the users. We ﬁrst describe the main characteristics of the data and explore the user attributes including age, region, activity, and more, with a series of interactive illustrations. Furthermore, an important ﬁrst step towards understating of political manipulation via user targeting is to identify politically related ads, yet manually checking ads is not feasible due to the scale of social media advertising. Consequently, we address the challenge of automatically classifying between political and non-political ads, demonstrating a signiﬁcant improvement compared to the current text-based classiﬁer used by ProPublica, and study whether the user targeting attributes are beneﬁcial for this task. Our evaluation sheds light on questions, such as how user attributes are being used for political ads targeting and which users are more prone to be targeted with political ads. Overall, our contribution of data exploration, political ad classiﬁcation and initial analysis of the targeting attributes, is designed to support future work with the ProPublica dataset, and speciﬁcally with regard to the understanding of political manipulation via user targeting.},

However, targeted advertising can also be abused by malicious advertisers to efficiently reach people susceptible to false stories, stoke grievances, and incite social conflict. Since targeted ads are not seen by non-targeted and non-vulnerable people, malicious ads are likely to go unreported and their effects undetected. This work examines a specific case of malicious advertising, exploring the extent to which political ads 1 from the Russian Intelligence Research Agency (IRA) run prior to 2016 U.S. elections exploited Facebook’s targeted advertising infrastructure to efficiently target ads on divisive or polarizing topics (e.g., immigration, race-based policing) at vulnerable subpopulations. In particular, we do the following: (a) We conduct U.S. census-representative surveys to characterize how users with different political ideologies report, approve, and perceive truth in the content of the IRA ads. Our surveys show that many ads are “divisive”: they elicit very different reactions from people belonging to different socially salient groups. (b) We characterize how these divisive ads are targeted to sub-populations that feel particularly aggrieved by the status quo. Our findings support existing calls for greater transparency of content and targeting of political ads. (c) We particularly focus on how the Facebook ad API facilitates such targeting. We show how the enormous amount of personal data Facebook aggregates about users and makes available to advertisers enables such malicious targeting.},

The goal of this work is to explore UAV vulnerability to deceptive GPS signals. Speciﬁcally, this paper (1) establishes the necessary conditions for UAV capture via GPS spooﬁng, and (2) explores the spoofer’s range of possible post-capture control over the UAV. A UAV is considered captured when a spoofer gains the ability to eventually specify the UAV’s position and velocity estimates. During post-capture control, the spoofer manipulates the true state of the UAV, potentially resulting in the UAV ﬂying far from its ﬂight plan without raising alarms. Both overt and covert spooﬁng strategies are considered, as distinguished by the spoofer’s attempts to evade detection by the target GPS receiver and by the target navigation system’s state estimator, which is presumed to have access to non-GPS navigation sensor data. GPS receiver tracking loops are analyzed and tested to assess the spoofer’s capability for covert capture of a mobile target. The coupled dynamics of a UAV and spoofer are analyzed and simulated to explore practical post-capture control scenarios. A ﬁeld test demonstrates capture and rudimentary control of a rotorcraft UAV, which results in unrecoverable navigation errors that cause the UAV to crash.},

	abstract = {With the increasing adoption of location-based social network applications, a large number of location traces of human mobility have been collected and published for the purpose of assisting mobile system design and scientific research. Most mobility traces are processed to achieve anonymity before publishing by the way of replacing the true IDs and introducing noise interference. In this paper, we show that such anonymous mobility traces are vulnerable to asynchronous side information attack from the edge: if partial movement information is exposed to some compromised edge nodes even after the data collection period, the adversary is able to identify the participant from the anonymous mobility traces with high probability. Our method to identify participants is based on exploring the accumulative temporal and spatial characteristics of individual movement. We introduce {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}delta{\textbackslash})-partition to divide user locations into sub-areas, and {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash})-partition to group user activities into time intervals. We illustrate that a mobility trace can be uniquely represented by a set of frequent locations together with their active time intervals. We further derive a similarity measurement to be used by the adversary for asynchronous side information attack. We develop theoretical analysis to prove that an anonymous participant can be correctly identified with high probability under certain condition. Extensive experiments are conducted on three typical mobility datasets corresponding to the movement of bus, taxi and human, which show that the identification success ratio achieves 99\%, 45\% and 72\%, respectively.},

This information, however, can compromise individual privacy, particularly as social media platforms use it to infer detailed models of user behavior, including tracking their location. We consider the speciﬁc issue of location privacy as potentially revealed by posting photo collections, which facilitate accurate geolocation with the help of deep learning methods even in the absence of geotags. One means to limit associated inadvertent geolocation privacy disclosure is by carefully pruning select photos from photo collections before these are posted publicly. We study this problem formally as a combinatorial optimization problem in the context of geolocation prediction facilitated by deep learning. We ﬁrst demonstrate the complexity both by showing that a natural greedy algorithm can be arbitrarily bad and by proving that the problem is NP-Hard. We then exhibit an important tractable special case, as well as a more general approach based on mixedinteger linear programming. Through extensive experiments on real photo collections, we demonstrate that our approaches are indeed highly effective at preserving geolocation privacy.},

This data poses signiﬁcant security, privacy, and ethical risks: it’s been shown that users can be re-identiﬁed in such datasets, and its collection rarely involves their full consent or knowledge. This data is valuable to private ﬁrms (e.g. targeted marketing) but also presents clear value as a public good. Recent public interest research has demonstrated that high-resolution location data can more accurately measure segregation in cities and provide inexpensive transit modeling. But as data is aggregated to mitigate its re-identiﬁability risk, its value as a good diminishes. How do we rectify the clear security and safety risks of this data, its high market value, and its potential as a resource for public good? We extend the recently proposed concept of a tradeoff curve that illustrates the relationship between dataset utility and privacy. We then hypothesize how this tradeoff differs between private market use and its potential use for public good. We further provide real-world examples of how high resolution location data, aggregated to varying degrees of privacy protection, can be used in the public sphere and how it is currently used by private ﬁrms.},

	abstract = {In recent years we have witnessed a shift towards personalized, context-based applications and services for mobile device users. A key component of many of these services is the ability to infer the current location and predict the future location of users based on location sensors embedded in the devices. Such knowledge enables service providers to present relevant and timely offers to their users and better manage trafﬁc congestion control, thus increasing customer satisfaction and engagement. However, such services suffer from location data leakage which has become one of today’s most concerning privacy issues for smartphone users. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally on location data that is exposed by Android applications via Internet network trafﬁc in plaintext (i.e., without encryption) without the user’s awareness. We present an empirical evaluation, involving the network trafﬁc of real mobile device users, aimed at: (1) measuring the extent of location data leakage in the Internet trafﬁc of Android-based smartphone devices; and (2) understanding the value of this data by inferring users’ points of interests (POIs). This was achieved by analyzing the Internet trafﬁc recorded from the smartphones of a group of 71 participants for an average period of 37 days. We also propose a procedure for mining and ﬁltering location data from raw network trafﬁc and utilize geolocation clustering methods to infer users’ POIs. The key ﬁndings of this research center on the extent of this phenomenon in terms of both ubiquity and severity; we found that over 85\% of devices of users are leaking location data, and the exposure rate of users’ POIs, derived from the relatively sparse leakage indicators, is around 61\%.},

We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals.},

Each day, millions of people use Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, and many other social media services and applications to stay connected with friends and family. We broadcast personal information such as our names, location, occupation, spouse’s and children’s names, personal photographs and videos, and other intimate details of our everyday lives. Social media sites monetize this free exchange of personal information by capturing and mining this data and significant metadata for advertising and other revenue generation activities. As we have divulged more of our private lives on social websites and applications, the opportunities for criminals to victimize users by capturing and mining this same information has increased exponentially. Yet, most social media users are unaware of the dangers that exist with even their casual use of social media. We found that our privacy is not well protected by neither the social media companies nor the law as it relates to our social media activities, and, therefore, consumers must take the initiative to understand the privacy implications of their social media activities.},

	abstract = {A valuable body of literature critiques the ways in which data generated by individuals through their smartphone and mobile media use are collected and controlled by governments, state-based institutions and corporations. However, alongside this much-needed critical scholarship, it is necessary to identify the specific attitudes of users towards locational data collection activities and, by extension, the differing levels of socio-technical literacy that exist among smartphone users. This article presents evidence of the attitudes of train commuters about the geolocation mapping of their movement via smartphone Wi-Fi signals. Involving significant methodological challenges, the study used Simple Observation combined with a three-question survey of 100 commuters completed at a major train station in Melbourne, Australia, over a three-day period. Based on the evidence collected and analysed, the findings show that attitudes are grouped into six categories: (1) in favour, (2) in favour with guarantees, (3) sceptical, (4) staunchly opposed, (5) confused, and (6) apathetic. We propose that publicly visible initiatives to raise awareness about the collection and utilisation of smartphone data are essential to inform citizens about their locational privacy, especially given the continuing spread of sensor-based monitoring systems in public spaces and so-called smart cities.},

Now we found by integrating some open source projects related to GPS we can produce GPS signal through SDR tools, e.g. USRP / bladeRF. This makes the attack cost very low. It may influence all the civilian use GPS chipset. In this presentation, the basic GPS system principle, signal structure, mathematical models of pseudo-range and Doppler effect will be introduced.

	abstract = {The 2016 United States presidential election was marked by the abuse of targeted advertising on Facebook. Concerned with the risk of the same kind of abuse to happen in the 2018 Brazilian elections, we designed and deployed an independent auditing system to monitor political ads on Facebook in Brazil. To do that we first adapted a browser plugin to gather ads from the timeline of volunteers using Facebook. We managed to convince more than 2000 volunteers to help our project and install our tool. Then, we use a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to detect political Facebook ads using word embeddings. To evaluate our approach, we manually label a data collection of 10k ads as political or non-political and then we provide an in-depth evaluation of proposed approach for identifying political ads by comparing it with classic supervised machine learning methods. Finally, we deployed a real system that shows the ads identified as related to politics. We noticed that not all political ads we detected were present in the Facebook Ad Library for political ads. Our results emphasize the importance of enforcement mechanisms for declaring political ads and the need for independent auditing platforms.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-46484-8_3},
	abstract = {Is it possible to build a system to determine the location where a photo was taken using just its pixels? In general, the problem seems exceptionally difﬁcult: it is trivial to construct situations where no location can be inferred. Yet images often contain informative cues such as landmarks, weather patterns, vegetation, road markings, and architectural details, which in combination may allow one to determine an approximate location and occasionally an exact location. Websites such as GeoGuessr and View from your Window suggest that humans are relatively good at integrating these cues to geolocate images, especially enmasse. In computer vision, the photo geolocation problem is usually approached using image retrieval methods. In contrast, we pose the problem as one of classiﬁcation by subdividing the surface of the earth into thousands of multiscale geographic cells, and train a deep network using millions of geotagged images. While previous approaches only recognize landmarks or perform approximate matching using global image descriptors, our model is able to use and integrate multiple visible cues. We show that the resulting model, called PlaNet, outperforms previous approaches and even attains superhuman levels of accuracy in some cases. Moreover, we extend our model to photo albums by combining it with a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. By learning to exploit temporal coherence to geolocate uncertain photos, we demonstrate that this model achieves a 50\% performance improvement over the singleimage model.},

Nonetheless, these providers have a strong incentive to create very detailed profile of users to better monetize the collected data. End users are usually not aware about the strength and wide range of inference that can be performed from their mobility traces. In this demonstration, users interact with a web-based application to inspect their location history and to discover the inferential power of this kind of data. Moreover to better understand the possible countermeasures, users can apply a sanitization to protect their data and visualize the impact on both the mobility traces and the associated inferred information. The objective of this demonstration is to raise the user awareness on the profiling capabilities and the privacy threats associated with disclosing his location data as well as how sanitization mechanisms can be efficient to mitigate these privacy risks. In addition, by collecting users feedbacks on the personal information revealed and the usage of a geosanitization mechanism, we hope that this demonstration will also be useful to constitute a new and valuable dataset on users perceptions on these questions.},

	abstract = {The wide adoption of mobile devices has created unprecedented opportunities to collect mobility traces and make them available for the research community to conduct interdisciplinary research. However, mobility traces available in the public domain are usually restricted to traces resulting from a single sensor (e.g., either GPS, GSM or WiFi). In this paper, we present the PRIVA’MOV dataset, a novel dataset collected in the city of Lyon, France on which user mobility has been collected using multiple sensors. More precisely, this dataset contains mobility traces of about 100 persons including university students, staff and their family members over 15 months collected through the GPS, WiFi, GSM, and accelerometer sensors. We provide in this paper both a quantitative and a preliminary qualitative analysis of this dataset. Speciﬁcally, we report the number of visited points of interests, GSM antennas and WiFi hotspots and their distribution across the various users. We ﬁnally analyse the uniqueness of human mobility by considering the various sensors.},

This data is sometimes published after the application of simple anonymization techniques, which might lead to severe privacy threats. We propose in this paper a new solution whose novelty is two-fold. Firstly, we introduce an algorithm designed to hide places where a user stops during her journey (namely points of interest), by enforcing a constant speed along her trajectory. Secondly, we leverage places where users meet to take a chance to swap their trajectories and therefore confuse an attacker.},
